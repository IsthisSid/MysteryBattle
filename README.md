#### Background
There are so many *Rock, Paper, Scissors* games available, all written in different languages. 
I decided to code one in C# using Windows Forms in .NET. 
Although the code structure is essentially the same, I changed up the theme and added a few silly features.

#### App Details
* Design and UI: The Player chooses Wizard, Sorceress, or Mystery. The Robo chooses one as well. May the best spell-caster win. :smile:
* Programming language used: C#
